What do you mean by open-source contribution?
---------------------------------------------

Open-Source Software is a type of software whose code is publicly
available to use and modify. Open-Source Contribution involves
contributing to the development or improvement of open-source software.

Some popular Open-Source Software are the Linux Operating System,
Android, Mozilla Firefox, Chromium (which powers Google Chrome and
Microsoft Edge), VSCode IDE, VLC Media Player, WordPress Content Manager
System, etc.

Open Source is something each one of us is inevitably using every day,
possibly without being aware of it. Interestingly the code that resulted
in the first manned mission to the moon is also open-sourced. Yes, I am
talking about [Apollo 11](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/).

Why should I contribute to open-source?
---------------------------------------

Ever wonder if all these projects/software were single-handedly
maintained by a single developer?\
What would have been its impact on them and pretty much on us?

The software would not have had so many features and upgradations. This
is where open source contribution comes in. Contributors from around the
world help develop and improve the software for every one of us who use
it. Being a contributor will give you the super-power to be a part of
something that is impacting so many lives.

Apart from the impact that you get to create, it also helps you become a
better developer and with time a good mentor, leader, and passionate
team player.

Prerequisites before starting to contribute
-------------------------------------------

### Learn a programming language

Since open-source contribution requires you to read/write code if you
want to be involved in its development, you are required to learn a
programming language to get started. You can get started with any
language of your choice. You can easily learn another language at a
later stage if a project requires it.

Many people help with documentation, translation, etc as well which does
not require programming. If you do not want to contribute as a developer
then you can skip this step.

### Get Familiar with Version Control Systems (VCS)

When we are working on a big project, it is extremely important to store
all the changes that are being made to recall it at a later stage.
Version Control Systems are software tools that help with it. They keep
track of all the modifications that happen over time in the source code
as versions. They also allow us to go through older versions and revert
to an old version if required.

You can read more about VCS here - [What is version
control?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

There are many version control systems such as Git, Mercurial, CVS, and
SVN. Git is the most popular and most widely used version control system
in the industry.

#### Git

Git is the most popular open-source distributed VCS used with most
commercial and non-commercial projects.

These resources might help you learn Git from scratch:

-   [Git Tutorials and Trainings from
    Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)
-   [TryGit](https://try.github.io/)

In the initial stages, this cheat sheet might be very handy: [GIT CHEAT
SHEET](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

#### GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration using the Git
Version Control System. In layman’s term, it is the place where you keep
all your projects and multiple people can work together on those
projects.

Good resources to get started with GitHub:

-   [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)
-   [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners - Traversy
    Media](https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc)
-   [Git and GitHub crash course from
    FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk)

Note that you do not need to be a master in VCS/Git/GitHub to start
contributing. Once you are comfortable with the basics, you can start
contributing to open-source.

How to get started with open-source contribution?
-------------------------------------------------

### Open Source your projects

If you have already done some projects, open-sourcing your projects
might be a good way to get started. Put it on GitHub and seek
contributions from the community. This will not only add value to your
project but will also help you to collaborate with many developers
around the world.

Many widely-used frameworks and libraries were open-sourced by
individual developers. Several people started collaborating and
maintaining these projects after the projects got popular. 

If you do not wish to start with your project, it is totally fine to
move to the next step directly.

### Solve beginner-friendly issues

Solving a beginner-friendly issue will help you get started with
contributing to an existing project.

You can get started by making your first contribution
[here](http://github.com/JGEC-Winter-of-Code/Beginner-Repo/).

Here are some good resources for finding beginner-friendly issues:

-   [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net)
-   [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)
-   [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
-   [First Timers Only](https://firsttimersonly.com/)
-   [Your First PR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/)
-   [CodeTriage](https://codetriage.com/)
-   [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com)

Alternatively, one can go to GitHub and search for easy,
beginner-friendly, or good first issues.\
The following links might be helpful:

-   Good First issue [is:issue is: open label:"good first
    issue"](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
-   Easy Issue: [is:issue is: open
    label:easy](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy)
-   First Timer Issue: [is:issue is:open
    label:first-timers-only](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timers-only)

You can then select or filter repositories based on your interest.

Notice "is:open" in all of the above links. This denotes open issues
that have not been resolved yet. 

While solving issues do check if the same issue is being taken up by
someone else or not. This means that if you find an issue in the
codebase and someone else has already raised a PR, make sure not to pick
up that issue.  

### Start contributing to Open-Source actively

-   Find projects or organizations that you are interested in
    contributing to.
-   Go to their GitHub repository, read the documentation, and search
    for first-timer issues as mentioned above.
-   Try to work on as many issues as you can either across projects or
    for a single project.
-   Join their IRC channel (Gitter/Discord/Slack, etc.). Introduce
    yourself and ask for help when stuck. You can find the link to the
    channels on their GitHub pages.
-   You can also create issues after running the application locally.
-   Once you are comfortable with contributing to open-source, start
    participating in open source programs.

Open-Source Programs/Contests you can participate in
----------------------------------------------------

There are many open-source coding programs that you can participate in.

-   [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
    (GSoC)\
    GSoC is the Olympics of Open Source. It is a global program focused
    on encouraging more student developers to do open source software
    development.\
    Students work with one of the selected open-source organizations for
    3 months and get a handsome stipend on completing the project.
    Students need to propose changes that they want to work on to get
    selected.\
    It is a good idea to start contributing to your favorite
    orgs/project much before GSoC.
-   [HacktoberFest\
    ](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)HacktoberFest is a
    month-long celebration of open source software carried out in
    October. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.\
    It is open to everyone in the global community!\
    One needs to complete a certain amount of quality PRs to get swags
    in return. The swag motivates many people to get started with
    open-source contributions through this program.
-   [GirlScript Summer of Code\
    ](https://www.gssoc.tech/)GirlScript Summer of Code is a 3 month
    long Open Source program during summers conducted by GirlScript
    Foundation, started in 2018, to help beginners get started with Open
    Source Development while encouraging diversity.\
    Note that it is open to everyone and not just girls as the program
    name might suggest.
-   [Outreachy\
    ](https://www.outreachy.org/)Outreachy (previously the Free and Open
    Source Software Outreach Program for Women) is a program that
    organizes three-month paid internships with [free and open-source
    software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
    projects.\
    It is for people who are typically underrepresented in those
    projects.\
    This is generally carried out biannual throughout the year.
-   [Rails Girl Summer of Code\
    ](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)Rails Girls Summer of Code is
    a global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into
    Open Source.\

    July-September, to work on Open Source projects of their choice.
-   [MLH Fellowship\
    ](https://fellowship.mlh.io/)The MLH Fellowship is an internship
    alternative for software engineers.\
    Instead of working on a project for just one company, selected
    candidates contribute to Open Source projects that are used by
    companies around the world and are paid a competitive stipend during
    this tenure.
